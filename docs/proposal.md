# Introduction
The FAA Logisitics Center is home to the National Airspace System's supply chain depot. The FAA Logistics Center (FAALC) provides supply chain, MRO, and warehouse support for the FAA air traffic control network. The parts that the FAALC support are components of the overrall air traffic systems such as radars, navigation, weather, and communication systems. A call center exists at the FAALC to support customers (FAA Technicians at airports and FAA facilities) in the field. The Customer Care Center (CCC) supports customers from 6am to 9pm, taking thousands of calls per month. Customers may call to order parts, ask about an existing order, or request a warranty. It is important to answer all customer calls in order to have great customer service and support the customers completely.

In this project, the Customer Care Center's call center data will be analyzed. The supervisor for this project is the branch manager of the CCC, Tammy Loberg. Her email is tammy.loberg@faa.gov, her phone number is (405)-954-4935. Since I work for the FAALC this project is a paid through FAALC funding.

# Objectives
The objective for this project is to generate a predictive model for the CCC that can identify when the call center is suseptible to abandon calls. An abandon call occurs when a customer calls the CCC and hangs up before getting to talk with an Agent. Abandon Call rates are an important measure of call center performance. By identifying when the CCC is most suseptible utilizing a predictive model, we increase the opportunity at increasing operational performance. This can occur because Tammy, the call center branch manager, is able to allocate appropriate resources where necessary.
